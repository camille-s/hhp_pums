# household_pulse

Because of really annoying git lfs stuff, this is no longer a fork of [Nathan's repo](https://github.com/18kimn/household_pulse), but a clean do-over to focus on PUMS analysis.

~~This repo was made for Datahaven (although public for now). It has some cleaned versions of the Census ~household pulse survey released data. ~~

~~Data from the Excel files the Census put out were scraped together and put into "Data/clean_files" ~~
